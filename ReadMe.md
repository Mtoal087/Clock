# Clock Project

This repository, named "Clock," serves as a learning project for JavaScript in the context of web development. The primary focus of this project was to gain hands-on experience in manipulating styles using JavaScript and leveraging the current date to dynamically adjust the styles of a clock interface.

## Project Overview

The "Clock" project is a simple web application that displays a clock interface with real-time updates. The primary learning objectives include:

1. __JavaScript Styling__: Explore and implement techniques to dynamically manipulate styles using JavaScript, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

2. __Date Manipulation__: Utilize the JavaScript '__Date__' object to obtain and manipulate the current date and time. This information is then applied to update the clock interface real-time.

## Features
- __Real-Time Clock Display__: The web application displays a clock that updates in real-time based on the user's system clock.
- __Style Manipulation__: Learn how to use JavaScript to dynamically modify the styling of HTML elements, such as font size, color, and positioning, to enhance the visual appeal of the clock.

## Getting Started
To explore and run the "Clock" project locally, follow these steps:

1. __Clone the Repository:__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mtoal087/Clock.git
cd Clock
```
2. __Open the Project:__
Open the __'index.html'__ file in a web browser to view the clock interface.
